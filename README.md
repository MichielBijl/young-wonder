# Young Wonder
Good music, bad website

An accessible and much lighter version of the [Young Wonder website](http://youngwonder.me).
Because I really like their music, this is my gift to Rachel Koeman and Ian Ring.

View the [accessible and lighter version on GitHub pages](http://michielbijl.github.io/young-wonder/build/).

## Problems fixed
* More descriptive alt text
* Removed Bootstrap; don't need that (saved 153 KB)
* Removed jQuery; don't need that (saved 96 KB)
* Use .jpg instead of .png file for cover art (saved 302 KB)
* Resize social media icons (saved 26KB)

## Tested in
This project is tested in these browsers and works pretty well in all.
Internet Explorer 6 doesn't support transparency in PNG,
so the icons aren't all that readable, but you can still view the title info.

All other browsers are pretty consistent.

* Safari 9 on OS X 10.10 (also with VoiceOver)
* Chrome 47 on OS X 10.10 (also with ChromeVox 49)
* Firefox 43 on Ubuntu 15.10 (also with Orco 3.16)
* Internet Explorer 6 on Windows XP
* Internet Explorer 7-11 on Windows 7 (developer tools)
* Edge on Windows 10
